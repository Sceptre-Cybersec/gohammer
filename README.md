# ðŸ”¨ GOHAMMER ðŸ”¨
## Overview
GOHAMMER is a general purpose web fuzzer written in go. This project is partly educational to help me learn and play around with the GO language, but it also serves as a more versatile web fuzzer than many other web fuzzers out there.  
  
After playing many hack the box machines and being frustrated with how hard it is to use hydra for password fuzzing and how inflexible many other web fuzzers are, I decided to make one of my own with some functionality that I wish other web fuzzers had.  

## Useful Functionality:
- Supports request files captured by BurpSuite for a more flexible and easier fuzzing experience
- Fuzz anything in the request, from headers to request methods to upload file content
- Retry failed requests, never miss out on finding an important file due to a bad connection
- *Coming soon:* User configuration yaml file containing your desired default configuration so you don't have to look through your command line history to find you favourite command line parameters to use
- *Coming soon:* DOS mode for stress testing

## Speed:
The Speed varies depending on if you're fuzzing using the request file or not. Without using the request file the speed keeps up with ffuf and gobuster, but when using a request file the speed drops to about 50 requests per second using 32 threads. Additionally requests using the request file are a bit more prone to errors. Running through a wordlist of about 5000 words you can expect maybe about 3-4 errors. These requests usually still make it to the target though because they will be re-sent if they fail.

## Installation:
If you have GO installed:  
> go install github.com/wadeking98/gohammer  

## Example Usage:
Simple web fuzzing:  
> gohammer -u http://127.0.0.1/@0@ -t 32 -e .txt,.html,.php /home/me/myWordlist.txt  
  
Bruteforce username and password:
> gohammer -u https://some.site.com/ -method POST -d '{"user":"@0@", "password":"@1@"}' -t 32 /home/me/usernames.txt /home/me/passwords.txt  
  
Bruteforce username and password using wordlists like a user:pass list  
> gohammer -u https://some.site.com/ -method POST -d '{"user":"@0@", "password":"@1@"}' -t 32 -brute false /home/me/usernames.txt /home/me/passwords.txt  
  
Bruteforce username and password using request file:  
> gohammer -u https://some.site.com/ -f /home/me/Desktop/burpReq.txt -t 32 /home/me/usernames.txt /home/me/passwords.txt
